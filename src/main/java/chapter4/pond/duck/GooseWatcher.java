//        This code doesnâ€™t compile because we are not in the Goose class. The floatInWater()
//        method is declared in Bird. GooseWatcher is not in the same package as Bird, nor does it
//        extend Bird. Goose extends Bird. That only lets Goose refer to floatInWater() and not
//        callers of Goose.
